## Context

The project involves updating wireframes for our [system/app/website] to improve the user interface and experience. Wireframe v.1 served as the initial draft, focusing on core layout and navigation. Feedback from stakeholders highlighted the need for better usability, aesthetics, and feature clarity, leading to the development of Wireframe v.2.

## Decision

We decided to update the wireframes with the following changes based on the stakeholder suggestions:

1. Improved Layout and Navigation

Enhanced navigation flow with clearly defined menus and especially in 


2. Feature Additions

- Include logout and logout confirmation in student dashboard.
- Dashboard for user login and option for the user's role.
- Updated SSG Officer attendance view dashboard, including time-in and time-out.




## Consequences

### Positive

Usability: Improved navigation and content clarity.

Engagement: Enhanced aesthetics and interactivity boost user engagement.

### Negative

Development Time: Increased due to added features and complexity.

Testing Requirements: Additional usability testing is needed to validate changes.

Alternatives Considered

1. Minimal Updates

Focused only on fixing navigation issues without aesthetic improvements.

Easier to implement but would not fully address stakeholder feedback.

2. Complete Redesign

A full overhaul of the wireframes.

Would offer maximum improvements but at a significantly higher cost and time.

## Conclusion

The updated wireframes (v.2) provide a more user-friendly, visually appealing, and responsive interface. While the changes introduce additional complexity and development time, they significantly enhance user experience and meet stakeholder expectations.
