# üåä ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)

## What is ERD?

- An ERD visually represents the entities in a system, their attributes, and the relationships between them, providing a clear blueprint for database design.

## ERD Version 1

- https://github.com/KHRISTMAE/VALID8/blob/main/ERD/ERD%20V.1.jpg

- This ERD connects users, events, and attendance records to manage the Facial Recognition School Event Attendance System efficiently.

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Users (Students, Admins, Organizers, SSG Officers) log in using the User table, which assigns them roles (Role table).

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Students belong to a course (Course table) and can attend multiple events (Attendance table).

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Event Organizers create events (Event table), which students can register for and attend.

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ SSG Officers assist in event management, and their participation is tracked using a bridge table (Officer_Event).

- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Admins oversee the system, managing users and event records.

- This structure ensures secure authentication, event tracking, and role-based access to the system.

## ERD Version 2

- (https://github.com/KHRISTMAE/VALID8/blob/main/ERD/ERD%20V.2.jpg)

- Version 2 ERD introduces several enhancements and refinements compared to Version 1, making the system more structured and improving its ability to handle user roles, facial recognition, and event attendance.

- New Additions in ERD Version 2 (Compared to Version 1)

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Face Entity Table ‚Äì Stores facial recognition data linked to users.

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ User Roles Table ‚Äì Enables a many-to-many relationship between users and roles.

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Check-in Time, Check-out Time, Checkpoint, and Status fields in the Attendance table ‚Äì Provides more detailed attendance tracking.

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Username and FaceID (FK) fields in the User table ‚Äì Supports facial recognition login.

- 5Ô∏è‚É£ UserID (FK) in multiple tables (SSG Officer, Event Organizer, etc.) ‚Äì Ensures unified user management.

- These additions improve role flexibility, attendance monitoring, and facial recognition integration.
