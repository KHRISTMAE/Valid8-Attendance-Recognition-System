# Valid8 Project

The **Valid8** project consists of a **frontend** and **backend** application, each containerized using Docker. Docker Compose is used to orchestrate both services, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy the application.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine before running the project:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Valid8_ABCC.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd Valid8_ABCC
Create a .env file by copying the example file:

bash
Copy
Edit
cp .env.example .env
✏️ Edit the .env file if needed to adjust environment variables.

Build and run the containers using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --build
🌐 Access the Application
Frontend will be available at: http://localhost:5173

Backend will be running at: http://localhost:8000

These ports can be changed in the docker-compose.yml file or environment variables.

🧠 How It Works
This project uses Docker to separate the frontend and backend into their own containers. Docker Compose handles:

Building both images

Running containers

Networking between services

Backend: A Node.js/Express (or your backend stack) API that handles business logic and database interactions.

Frontend: A React (or your frontend stack) application that consumes the backend API and serves the user interface.

📝 Notes
Do not commit your actual .env file — only include .env.example in the repo.

For deployment (e.g., cloud), environment variables and volumes may need to be adjusted depending on your setup.

👨‍🏫 For Instructor Use
This repository is ready for deployment or demonstration. You can:

Pull and run the Docker containers

Review the folder structure and Docker configuration

Modify the .env file and docker-compose.yml as needed for cloud deployment
