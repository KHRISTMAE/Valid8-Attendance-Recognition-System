## 1. Project Overview

### Project Description:
- A high-end attendance checker that will automatically displays students who attended the events in JRMSU College of Engineering.

### Target Audience:
- Students

### Project Objectives
- Design an intuitive user interface that allows students to easily access their attendance records, receive real-time notifications, and view upcoming events, ensuring a seamless experience.

## 2. Functional Requirements

User Management: Admins can create, edit, and delete user accounts. Role-based access control for students, SSG officers, event organizers, and admins.
Event Management: Event organizers can create, edit, and delete events. 
Attendance Tracking: SSG Officer verifies student attendance via Face recognition
Attendance Reports: Admins can generate event attendance reports. Students can view their attendance history.
Security & Authentication: User login using credentials or Google/Facebook login. Secure API for communication between the website and backend.

### User Stories/ Use Cases

- I want to scan studentsâ€™ face using face recognition so that I can ensure accurate and efficient tracking of attendees.

**As an Event Organizer:**
- I want to create a new event by entering essential details such as the event name, date, time, location, and description.
- I want to easily edit or update event details whenever necessary.
- I want to define registration limits and deadlines for my events.
- I want to send email notifications or reminders to registered students about the event.

**As an Administrator:**
- I want to manage user accounts for students, Student officer, and event organizers.
- I want to oversee all events created within the system and review flagged attendance issues so that attendance accuracy is maintained.
