## 1. Project Overview

### Project Description:
- A high-end attendance checker that will automatically displays students who attended the events in JRMSU College of Engineering.

### Target Audience:
- Students

### Project Objectives
- Design an intuitive user interface that allows students to easily access their attendance records, receive real-time notifications, and view upcoming events, ensuring a seamless experience.

## 2. Functional Requirements

User Management: Admins can create, edit, and delete user accounts. Role-based access control for students, SSG officers, event organizers, and admins.
Event Management: Event organizers can create, edit, and delete events. 
Attendance Tracking: SSG Officer verifies student attendance via Face recognition
Attendance Reports: Admins can generate event attendance reports. Students can view their attendance history.
Security & Authentication: User login using credentials or Google/Facebook login. Secure API for communication between the website and backend.

### User Stories/ Use Cases
